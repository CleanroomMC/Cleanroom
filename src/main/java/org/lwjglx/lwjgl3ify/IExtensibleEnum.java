/**
 * To be implemented on vanilla enums that should be enhanced with ASM to be extensible. If this is implemented on a
 * class, the class must define a static method called "create" which takes a String (enum name), and the rest of the
 * parameters matching a constructor.
 * <p>
 * For example, an enum with the constructor {@code MyEnum(Object foo)} would require the method:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 
 * public static MyEnum create(String name, Object foo) {
 *     throw new IllegalStateException("Enum not extended");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The method contents will be replaced with ASM at runtime. Multiple {@code create} methods <strong>can</strong> be
 * defined as long as each matches a constructor.
