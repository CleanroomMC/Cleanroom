# Cleanroom Feature Proposal Guidelines

1. Be as descriptive as possible!
2. Keep the content sensible.
3. Keep the profanities to a minimal level.
4. Don't spam proposals that are still in draft stage, the triage will take a look at it in due time!
5. Or, just don't spam at all!
6. Feel free to ping a triage member whenever the proposal has moved to a new stage, but only once!
