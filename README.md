### Ideas

- Meshlet
  - Definition: a meshlet is a small subdivision of geometry used as the fundamental rendering unit
  - It enables better culling and more
  - Each ChunkComponent contains multiple meshlets
  - Each MeshletComponent stores virtual geometry data, metadata (meshlet AABB etc.)
  - Merge and simplify meshlets based on LOD (somewhat easy cuz actual vertex & index gen are on GPU-side)
  - Split custom models to meshlets too (a challenge on how to design virtual geometry)
- Virtual Geometry
  - Goal: reduce CPU–GPU bandwidth by avoiding full mesh data uploads
  - So virtual geometry are high-level metadata
  - Actual vertex & index gen are on GPU-side
  - Metadata is lightweight and hopefully it'll be easier to merge and simplify meshlets
- Probe & Surface Cache Card -> Semi-static Diffuse GI
  - Each meshlet has one or more cards that record radiance, normal, color, etc. (might need a better card allocation strategy)
  - Probes are placed in world dynamically
  - Probes sample light sources and other cards (recursive indirect lighting with temporal accumulation; i.e. not heavy)
  - As a result, lighting info is updated gradually over frames, smoothing out noise
  - Cards read lighting info from surrounding probes
  - LOD affects the number of cards per meshlet
  - The light radiance and normal are interpolated per-pixel during shading, providing a somewhat accurate lighting
- Screen-space Radiance Cache
  - Probes & cards only provide a rough & semi-static lighting, but SSRC refines result in screen-space
  - SSRC is like a ray-traced final gather

Meshing: meshlet + virtual geometry<br>
Lighting: Semi-static Diffuse GI with Temporal Accumulation + SSRC

### Follow-up Ideas

- Maintain a meshlet pool with a fixed number of free meshlets, similar to how EntityManager works
- Destroy and reallocate meshlets during Load / Unload / Modify chunk callbacks
- Each ChunkComponent contains multiple MeshletHandle (meshletID + generation; so it's easy to check if a meshlet has expired)
- Try to decouple chunks and meshlets: chunks are not the owners of meshlets but the input of our meshlet gen function
- Similarily, meshlets are not the owners of surface cards but the input of our surface card gen function
- Enforce the idea of functional programming paradigm: inputs -> outputs, separating logic from resource management
- Treat ChunkComponent as 16x16x16 sections instead of 16x16x256? be friendly to future cubic chunks

<summary>Current Todos</summary>

- ECS world system coordinator (DAG). edge -> system; node -> barrier
- Modify EntityManager - callback on flush
- MeshletManager ?
